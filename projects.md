# Projects  

Welcome to my projects page! Below, I've included a selection of data engineering, analytics, and data science projects that showcase my technical skills and problem-solving capabilities.

## **1. Marketing Campaign Analysis**  
- **Description**: As part of my capstone project for the MIT Professional Studies Applied Data Science program, I designed and implemented a customer segmentation analysis using Python in Google Colab. This project involved extracting and preprocessing customer data from a CSV file and applying multiple machine-learning algorithms to uncover distinct customer segments. I identified key customer groups based on purchasing behavior and demographics by leveraging techniques such as K-Means clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models. The project also explored potential marketing strategies tailored to each segment, optimizing engagement and improving targeting precision. This experience honed my skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, machine learning model evaluation, and strategic insights derived from data.
- **Objective**: Identify customer segments to guide targeted marketing strategies.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Google Colab, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib    
- **Highlights**:  
  - Applied K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to cluster customer data.  
  - Achieved meaningful segmentation using feature engineering and silhouette scores.  
  - Visualized cluster patterns and provided actionable insights for stakeholders.

## **2. Stock Price Ingestion**   
- **Description**: In this project, I successfully developed a real-time streaming solution for Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock prices using the Yahoo Finance API and Apache Kafka. The real-time data was streamed and ingested into Microsoft SQL Server, stored, and processed for further analysis. I then created interactive and insightful visualizations using Power BI to provide an intuitive view of stock price trends, volatility, and key metrics. The entire project was managed through GitHub to ensure efficient version control and collaboration. Additionally, I integrated generative AI to enhance various aspects of the project, including data analysis, code development, and troubleshooting, improving efficiency and reducing development time. This project strengthened my skills in real-time data processing, database management, business intelligence, and leveraging AI for enhanced decision-making.
- **Objective**: Stream APPL stock prices to Microsoft SQL Server using Apache Kafka. 
- **Tools Used**: Python, Apache Kafka, Microsoft SQL Server, PowerShell, Power BI 
- **Highlights**:  
  - Designed and implemented a real-time streaming pipeline leveraging Apache Kafka and the Yahoo Finance API for continuous stock price ingestion.  
  - Automated the orchestration of multiple Python scripts using Python and PowerShell, ensuring seamless and efficient execution.
  - Integrated minute-by-minute stock price data into Microsoft SQL Server, enabling dynamic visualization and trend analysis with Power BI.

## **3. Email Attachment Downloader**  
- **Description**: In this project, I developed an automated solution using Google Apps Script (written in JavaScript) to download email attachments from Gmail and organize them into a designated folder in Google Drive. The script scans incoming emails for attachments, downloads them, and stores them in a dynamically created folder within Google Drive.
- **Objective**: Automatically download email attachments and place them in a Google Drive folder. 
- **Tools Used**: Google App Scripts  
- **Highlights**:  
  - Code written in JavaScript.  
  - Email attachments are automatically downloaded each month based on the label.  
  - Once the files are downloaded, they are placed in a new folder for each month.
